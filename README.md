## Overall Nestjs notes

- nest commands: 
-- "nest g module/controller/service/resource moduleName" 
--- The resource starts a module with everything you need. Module, controller, service, dtos and entities.
--- Ps.: entities might not be needed when you're using the prisma model schemas.

- nest specifics inner-workings:

-- The order of the controllers and how they're organized does matter. 
--- So if a get route /users is above all other routes, and the second route is /users/:id, the third route cannot be /users/interns (consider interns a collection of users with an 'intern' role.)
--- Nest js in this case would try to find the id of a specific intern and return it to you.
--- In this case, /users should be first, /users/interns should be second, and /users/:id should be third. 


-- A Provider doesn't necessarily NEED to be a service, but it often is. The main idea of a provider is that it can be injected as a dependency; this means objects can create various relationships with each other, and the function of "wiring up" these objects can largely be delegated to the Nest runtime system.

-- Injecting a service in a controller:
--- constructor(private readonly usersService: UsersService) {}
--- Nest js injects services as a singleton with the above line, that means that if the service has already been created elsewhere, you don't need to recreate it again (const usersService = new UsersService()), 

-- All params are strings and you have to convert them to the necessary types.
--- For this, you can use an unary + (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Unary_plus) before passing the values to their respective service methods.
--- So when you receive a param, you take the (Param id) and pass it to the new method like this: myService.myMethod(+id);

-- PIPES in Nestjs.

-- A pipe is a class annotated with the @Injectable() decorator, which implements the PipeTransform interface. They're specific types of middlewares used for both transformation and validation of data.


# Prisma Commands

- For installing prisma as a dev dependency: 

```npm i prisma -D```

- For generating the first database: 

```npx prisma migrate dev```

- For creating the prisma folder in your project:

```npx prisma init```

- For starting the database from your first schema:

```npx prisma migrate --name init```

- For making changes to your model and applying them to the Database:

```npx prisma generate```
```npx prisma migrate dev --name property_change```

---- A question I have: in the video tutorial he is importing just a single DatabaseModule for every single service... 
---- But shouldn't i have a DatabaseModule (or a repository) for each entity?
